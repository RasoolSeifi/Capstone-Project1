    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>My interests can be summarized in 5 things</h2>
    <hr />
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Lover of mysticism and Sufism:</li></h3>
        <img src="../assets/sufi.jpg" height="200" alt="Sufi in meditation"/>
        <p>The purpose of human creation and its presence in this world is self-knowledge and existential mysticism.<br />
            I always spend some of my time reading Maulana Saadi, Hafez, Shams Tabrizi and other greats.</p>
        
            <h3><li>Blockchain:</li></h3>
        <img src="../assets/blockchain.jpg" height="200" alt="Blockchain's presence in all parts of future life"/>
        <p>I am very interested in cryptocurrencies and how smart contracts work and how they are programmed and run projects in this field.<br />
            I enjoy researching and holding cryptocurrencies, and one of my interests is the Tron blockchain.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Full Stack:</li></h3>
        <img src="../assets/fullstack.png" height="200" alt="Things a full-stack developer should be good at"/>
        <p>I have a strong interest and goal to fully understand and learn and become a full-stack developer.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Anime:</li></h3>
        <img src="../assets/anime.jpg" height="200" alt="Pictures of anime characters"/>
        <p>Anime is a starting point for better understanding the concepts of personality and spirituality that countries like Japan and China best describe.<br />
        Anime like Hayao Miyazaki's works, Soul Land, Berserk, and many others are among my favorites.</p>
        
        <h3><li>Archaeology:</li></h3>
        <img src="../assets/Archaeology.jpg" height="200" alt="An image of an ancient building or castle"/>
        <p>I always spend part of my time in very ancient and mountainous areas that reflect the way the ancients thought and experienced life.</p>
